        <h1>Harry Potter</h1>
        <p>Imagine a school in a castle filled with moving staircases, a sport played on flying broomsticks,
            an evil wizard intent on domination, an ordinary boy who's the hero of a whole world he doesn't know.
            This is the story that comes to life in the marvelous Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling.</p>
        <p>The Dark Lord, Voldemort, tried to murder Harry when he was just a baby-but he failed,
            killing Harry's parents but leaving him with a lightning-bolt scar. After Voldemort's disappearance,
            Harry is sent to live with his nasty aunt and uncle, far away from any hint of magic.
            But at the age of eleven, he is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
            and a magical world opens before him.</p>

        <h1>A Song of Ice and Fire</h1>
        <h4>"Winter is coming."</h4>
	   <p> As the inspiration of one of HBO's newest hit shows, "Game of Thrones" Martin's
            saga tells the story of multiple characters in the fictional lands of Westeros and Essos.
            All of whom take part in the struggle for the Iron throne, and control of the Seven kingdoms</p>
        <p>A Song of Ice and Fire takes place in a world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably.
            Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united
            under the Targaryen dynasty. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 peaceful summer years have passed
            since the rebellion that deposed the last Targaryen king and proclaimed Robert Baratheon king of the Seven Kingdoms.</p>

        <h1>Dresden Files</h1>
        <p>In the world of The Dresden Files, magic is real, along with vampires, demons, spirits, faeries,
            werewolves, outsiders, and other monsters. Although the supernatural is still widely discredited,
            it is practiced by some members of society.Each species in the series (humans, faeries, vampires, etc.)
            has its own political and societal rules and organizations. The human wizards depend on the White Council,
            while faeries may belong to either of two Faerie Courts, or none at all. Vampires may belong to any of four vampire courts.
        <p> Harry Dresden works as the world's only "consulting wizard", accepting supernatural cases from both
            human and non-human clients, as well as the Chicago PD's Special Investigation unit. As the series progresses,
            Dresden takes on an increasingly important role in the supernatural world at large as he works to protect
            the general public, making it difficult for him to get by as a working wizard and private investigator.
            He finds himself facing off against an increasing variety of creatures (including other wizards),
            while facing the realization that his various cases may all be tied together behind the scenes.
